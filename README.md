# eagle_rock_firefighter
Welcome to the GPS shortest route calculator for Eagle Rock. This project was designed as a side project with my professor 
as my mentor and supervisor for it (Dr. John Paul Wilkinson PCC). 

# Summary:
- This program essentially takes an input in the form of an address, or street and yields a path from the fire station that is 
closest to it.

### Features:
- In order to search up an address use
